# mouse_jiggler
This repository contains information about turning a nRF52840 Dongle (PCA10059) into a mouse jiggler device

A mouse jiggler is a hardware device that simulates tiny mouse movements which prevent the operation system to enter standby mode due to missing keyboard or mouse interactions.

You have differen options to get a mouse jiggler device:
- buy a commercial mouse jiggler device for less than 20 EUR
- buy a circuit python board from adafruit and copy a python control script to it
- buy a nRF52840 Dongle device, flash the boot loader, install circuit python and copy a python control script to it

Fortunately everything is already done before and documented at different web sites.
This repository only contains a summary of existing information found.

I added an additional video on vimeo to document the function of the device.
